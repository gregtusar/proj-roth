i'd like to create the notion of a Group. users will all be members of a group.
a group administrator can invite new members to the group, which creates entries for them in the user table. they can also delete members. all users have roles today, the person who signs up for the service first will be assigned the administrator role. When inviting new users, the administrator can make them one
