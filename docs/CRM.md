lets add a new feature called the Voter CRM, under the TOOLS section in the left nav. Maybe we should alphabetize the tools in the left nav under TOOLS please. The Voter CRM tool should bring up a new screen which has: 
	- an entry box with 'type ahead', in format last, first where the tool progressively trys to guess the name based on what you'd typed so far.
	- a search button. For results:

	- a section on their basic information: Name, Age, Race, Addresss and any address history, registration, email, ideally a picture if one is available from any source
	- a section with any PDL enrichment (please perform a PDL enrichment if the data isn't cached in our table) 
	- any other information readily available via the 'search tool' in the agent.

	- a section with voting history: list of primaries, list of generals

	- a section with donation history

	- a section 'events' that come from the events table

	- a section which allows the user to enter a new event, with notes, such as a 'Call Notes' event. And then save the input text into the events table.

	a dismiss button
